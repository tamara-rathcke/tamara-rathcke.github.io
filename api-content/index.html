I specialise in phonetics and laboratory phonology, and much of my research crosses disciplinary boundaries. I study prosody – all things unspoken that make verbal communication rich in meaning. I serve on the editorial board of the Journal of the International Phonetic Association, and regularly review for conferences, journals, publishers and funders. I teach courses on phonetics, phonology, morphology, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and am available to supervise theses in any of these fields.
